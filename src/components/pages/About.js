        This webpage is dedicated to an audivisual performance called "the Wizard, the King, and the Fool".
        It was initiated as a practicum project for the McBride Honors program, in which I was tasked with designing
        and conducting my own learning experience. In this learning experience I decided to combine my passions for 
        art, music, psychology, and philosophy and put together my first solo music performance with almost all original
        material. The Wizard, the King, & the Fool is a medieval theatre style psychological exploration, which inspired
        by the work of psychologist Carl Jung, uses music and computer generated art amongst other mediums to channel, 
        witness, and integrate the 'archetypes' of the 'collective unconscious' within myself (and hopefully
        inspire the audience to do the same).
      </p>
      <p>     
        As a part of this learning experience I was required to create a list of several objectives and outcomes. In the
        blog section you will find posts that reflect my journey towards fulfilling these objectives and outcomes, which are as follows:
      </p>
      <h3>
        Objectives:
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How is the “collective unconscious” revealed through artistic expression, and how can music be used to explore and integrate its archetypes within the conscious realm?
        </li>
        <li>
          How to self-organize and promote a small, independent, electronic music performance?
        </li>
        <li>
          How may singing skills be self-taught?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Outcomes:
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I can use music to acknowledge, understand, and integrate various character archetypes. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I can organize, create, and manage the resources necessary to organize my own musical performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can demonstrate audible improvement in vocal technique and ability.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The process of fulfilling these objectives/outcomes was organized according to Bloom's Taxonomy, a framework for
        building effective learning experiences. First, I gathered knowledge to understand my undertaking by reading and summarizing "The Archetypes and
        the Colelctive Unconscious" by Carl Jung while compiling two informative guides, "How to Train Your Voice" amd "How to
        Put Together a Performance" to reference throughout my experience. Secondly, I applied and analyzed what I learned
        in a series of blog posts where I documented the development of the performance narrative via "schema sketches" (which served
        as a sort of map to the performance), my vocal ability, and tackling the technicalities of the performance. Finally,
        I will put all of my experience together and organize my own performance. You can find my takeway of "The Archetypes
        and the Collective Unconscious", my how-to guides, as well as my blog posts documenting my journey all on this site.
